## CTFs: pentesting challenges

In this repository you will find documentation regarding vulnerabilities found in virtual machines describing each of the steps to the solution, software, CWEs and recommendations on how to fix such vulnerabilites. 

**NOTE:**

    I have divided each CTF challenge into folders which you can find above:

    01-<machine-name>
    02-<machine-name>

**LINK.lst file**:

- Contains the URL to the CTF challenge hosted on Vulnhub.
- The LINK.lst file is in each CTF challenge folder.
- You can use a hypervisor like VirtualBox or VMware to start solving CTF Challenges
